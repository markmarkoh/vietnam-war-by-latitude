# Thor By Latitude & Month

This visualization is my attempt at visualizing both *time* and *location* of action during the Vietnam War with a single visual. Using a Joyplot/Ridgeline plot, but encoding latitude as the Y axis, and positioning the map next to the Y axis, brings together the elements I think are needed for time and location to be present in a simple visualization.
